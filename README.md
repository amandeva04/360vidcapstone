This project explores how to optimize 360 video streaming by predicting where users will look next using path-based
prediction. By predicting the userâ€™s head movement, we aim to stream only the relevant portion of the screen instead 
of transmitting the full 360 screen. The goal is to reduce the bandwidth needed to stream 360 video while maintaining a 
positive user experience.
